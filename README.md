# 🎯 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning.

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Features include Age, Gender, Ticket Class, Fare, etc.

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
5. Model Evaluation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ✅ Results
- Best model accuracy: **82%**
- Random Forest performed the best.

## 🚀 How to Run
